### Teaching Assistants
##### Catherine Karpova
- Originally from Boston, Katya is a graduate student studying biomedical engineering, who received her bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering from GW in 2021. 
During the past three summers, Katya worked in Dr. Natasha Frank’s lab at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital / Harvard Medical School. 
The project was to 3D print an artificial limbus of the eye with dermal stem cells to treat limbal stem cell deficiency and corneal blindness. In the future, Katya wants to work in tissue engineering or in the biomedical device industry. 
Outside of classes, Katya competed on the university's Division I women’s gymnastics team as an undergraduate student. 
She enjoys dancing and exploring fun places in the city with her friends.

##### Sara Tenaglio
- Sara Tenaglio is a graduate student studying Biomedical Engineering, who received her undergraduate degree from GW in the same field of study last year. 
She is originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
Her primary interests lie in tissue engineering and cancer research, having worked in Dr. Zhang’s tissue engineering lab for the past four years, as well as Dr. Villagra’s lab in the cancer center for two. 
Aside from TAing and fulfilling her studies, she is currently working part-time for a start-up company called Cambridge Medical Technologies where she is participating in the development of a novel glucose sensor that accurately detects glucose levels without the need for pricking the finger. 
She also loves to travel, and having studied in Seoul, South Korea her fifth semester, she is a big advocate of study abroad and all of the wonderful opportunities that come with it.

##### Ethan Frink
- Ethan is a senior mechanical engineering student from Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He took APSC1001 in his first semester at GW! 
After the APSC1001 class, he worked in the Exergy Research Lab with Professor Bulusu to build a prototype ejector-based refrigerator model. 
He used Python programming to simulate the system. These experiences led to presentations within GW and a publication with the Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC2021). 
He joined Design/Build/Fly (DBF) my junior year and helped design the wing for the first flight-worthy remote-controlled aircraft at GW. 
He is now the Chief Engineer of the organization. Any interested new members can happily contact hium!
On a non-technical side, I studied abroad in Sydney during my 4th semester at GW and am part of the Symphonic Band and the C-brass pep band!
